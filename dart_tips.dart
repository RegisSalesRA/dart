## Fast review structures tips
```dart
variables always with lowerCamelCase
functions always with snakecase
files always with snakecase
import names prefixes with snakecase
class always with camelcase

DONâ€™T use prefix letters.
```

how you can know what type of from variable?
EX: print("VariableName".runtimeType);
